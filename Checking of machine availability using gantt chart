1. Write a plan form to save the following details:

Hint:(Can push hardcoded data in array)

    Machine ID = eg:MAC001

    Machine Total working time = eg: 4 hours

    Date = eg:Today

    Start Time = eg:06:00

    End Time = eg:14:00 (auto populate based on hours)


   Validation Needed = Time check availability before insert, No Duplicates, Valid Time, Machine ID, Working time.    


2. New Form for Planned Gantt Chart:

Search by Date=(default current date) and show Gantt chart of all Machine IDs based on selected date/time occupancy.


3. Run Unit tests in python to cover the validation scenarios, save criteria.

from datetime import datetime  
from datetime import timedelta
import pandas as pd
import plotly.figure_factory as ff
num = int(input("How many number of machine data you want to store? :"))


d = {"Task":[],"Start":[],"Finish":[]}
for i in range(num):
    n = input("enter the name:")
    d["Task"].append(n)
    hr,mint,sec = int(input("enter no. of hours")),int(input("enter no. of minutes")),int(input("enter no. of sec"))
    d['Start'].append(datetime(20,6,1,hr,mint,sec))
    d['Finish'].append(d["Start"][i]+timedelta(hours=4))

df = pd.DataFrame(d)
    
fig = ff.create_gantt(df)
fig.show()
